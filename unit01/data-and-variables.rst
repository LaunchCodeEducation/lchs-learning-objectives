Unit 1 - Data & Variables Learning Objectives
=============================================

Goals
-----

- Identify three primitive data types---``int, str, float``.
- Use variables to store program data.
- Carry out simple numeric calculations with code.
- Collect user input from the console.

Objectives
----------

Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^

Students will be able to:

- Explain what a **value** is.
- Explain what a **data type** is.
- Determine the data type of a value using ``type()``.
- Identify three common data types: ``int, str, float``.
- Convert between data types using the ``int()``, ``str()``, and ``float()``
  functions.


Variables
^^^^^^^^^

Students will be able to:

- Explain what a variable is.
- Assign or reassign a value to a variable using ``=``.
- Create legal, descriptive variable names.
- Describe what a **keyword** is, and identify commonly used keywords.
- Explain what an **expression** is.
- Explain what it means to **evaluate** an expression.
- Correctly build and evaluate expressions using the math **operators**: ``+``,
  ``-``, ``/``, ``*``, ``**``, ``//``, and ``%``.
- Evaluate expressions using **compound assignment operators**: ``+=``, ``-=``,
  ``*=``, ``/=``.
- Explain what the modulus operator ``%`` does.
- Recognize that Python evaluates expressions based on the rules for order of
  operations.

User Input
^^^^^^^^^^

Students will be able to:

- Explain the syntax for using ``input()`` to display a prompt in the console
  and collect user input.
- Store user input in a variable for use later in the program.
- Recognize that ``input`` collects user data as the ``str`` data type.
- Correctly convert user input to the ``int`` or ``float`` data type.
- Prompt the user multiple times and store their responses in different
  variables.

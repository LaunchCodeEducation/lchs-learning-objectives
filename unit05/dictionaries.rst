Unit 5 - Dictionaries Learning Objectives
=========================================

Goals
-----

- Create and use Python dictionaries.
- Recognize the benefits and drawbacks of dictionaries vs. lists.

Objectives
----------

Students will:

- Understand that dictionaries are collections of properties stored as
  **key/value pairs**.
- Recognize that dictionaries are *unordered* collections of data values.
- Create and assign dictionary values using ``{ }``.
- Describe the allowed data types for **keys** and **values**.
- Access and/or change the value of a key by using bracket notation.
- Use bracket notation to add new key/value pairs to a dictionary.
- Use the ``.keys()``, ``.values()``, and ``.items()`` methods to retrieve a
  list of the keys, values, or key/value pairs from a dictionary.
- Use a loop to iterate through the keys, values, or key/value paris of a
  dictionary.
- Utilize dictionaries as parameters, arguments, and return values of
  functions.

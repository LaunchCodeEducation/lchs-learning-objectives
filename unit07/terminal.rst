Unit 7 - Local Development Objectives (Terminal & VSCode)
=========================================================

Goals
-----

- Understand what the terminal is and how to use it.
- Become familiar with the Visual Studio Code workspace.
- Create and save programs locally, and run them from VSCode.

Objectives
----------

Terminal
^^^^^^^^

Students will:

- Know what a **terminal** is and why programmers use it.
- Recognize how a **command line interface** (CLI) behaves compared to a
  **graphical user interface** (GUI).

  ``mkdir``, ``rm``, and ``touch``.
- Be able to check which version(s) of Python are available on their device.
- Run Python programs from the terminal.
- Understand how to stop processes that are running in the terminal.

Visual Studio Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students will:

- Understand what **local development** means and explain how it differs from
  working in repl.it or Trinket.
- Know how to use the **code editor** and **file tree** panels in Visual Studio
  Code (VSCode).
- Be able to open up the terminal in VSCode.
- Create, save, open, and run Python programs in VSCode.
- Understand how to import Python modules from the same folder or from
  different folders in the file tree.
- Create HTML/CSS files locally and display them in a browser.

Note To Administrators
----------------------

If your school district places restrictions on student devices, the IT
department must make sure that all required software is installed prior to
student use.

For desktops/laptops, this includes Visual Studio Code, GitBash (Windows), and
the latest stable version of Python.

For Chromebooks, students will need access to a Virtual Desktop that contains
the required software.

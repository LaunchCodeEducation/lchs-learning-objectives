Note To Administrators
----------------------

If your school district places restrictions on student devices, the IT
department must make sure that all required software is installed prior to
student use.

For desktops/laptops, this includes Visual Studio Code, GitBash (Windows) or
Git (Mac), and the latest stable version of Python.

For Chromebooks, students will need access to a Virtual Desktop that contains
the required software.

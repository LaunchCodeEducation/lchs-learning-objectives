Unit 4 - Modules Learning Objectives
====================================

Goals
-----

- Import predefined Python modules into new programs 
- Create user-defined modules to export to other programs

Objectives
----------

Students will:

- Explain what a **module** represents and why it is useful.
- Be able to import pre-defined Python modules into a program.
- Be able to call functions imported from a module.
- Explain the difference between ``import module_name`` and
  ``from module_name import function_name``.
- Use common functions from the ``random`` module: ``choice``, ``randint``,
  ``random``.
- Use common functions and constants from the ``math`` module: ``ceil``,
  ``floor``, ``pi``, ``sqrt``.
- Use the ``round()`` function with different ``random`` and ``math``
  functions.
- Create their own modules and successfully import them into other programs.
- Understand why adding a ``main()`` function is important when building a
  module.

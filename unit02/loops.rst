Unit 2 - Loops Learning Objectives
==================================

Goals
-----

- Use iteration to repeat the execution of a code block
- Properly write ``for`` and ``while`` loops
- Understand which type of loop is better suited for a given situation.

Objectives
----------

``for`` Loops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students will be able to:

- Describe the role of each of the 3 components of the ``range`` type:
  ``start``, ``stop``, and ``step``.
- Recognize that only the ``stop`` component in ``range`` is required.
- Explain what **zero-based indexing** means, and provide examples.
- Write a ``for`` loop with ``range(start, stop)`` to iterate upwards
  from 0 - n, downwards from n - 0, upwards from m - n, and downwards from
  m - n.
- Write a ``for`` loop with ``range(start, stop, step)`` to iterate upwards
  or downwards in increments larger than 1 unit.
- Iterate over strings without using index values.
- Iterate over strings using index values.

``while`` Loops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students will be able to:

- Write a ``while`` loop with a simple comparison condition
- Write a ``while`` loop that validates user input
- Explain the differences between **definite** and **indefinite** iteration.

Loop Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students will be able to:

- Describe the behavior of an infinite loop and how to avoid it.
- Understand the differences between ``for`` and ``while`` loops, and when each
  is preferred.
- Use the ``break`` keyword to end a loop.
- Use the **accumulator pattern** to steadily increase or decrease the value of
  a running total, or to increase the length of a string.

Unit 2 - Conditionals Learning Objectives
=========================================

Goals
-----

- Understand how common boolean expressions are evaluated
- Use boolean expressions to create conditional statements

Objectives
----------

Booleans
^^^^^^^^

- Explain what a boolean value is
- Explain what logical operators are
- Explain what a boolean expression is
- Use the operators ``==`` ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` to compare values
- Write boolean expressions using these *comparison operators*
- Write boolean expressions using the logical operators ``and``, ``or``, ``not``
- Understand the truth tables for the logical operators ``and`` and ``or``
- Explain and properly implement expressions that rely on operator precedence

Conditionals
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Explain the relationship between conditionals and boolean expressions
- Write an ``if`` statement with and without an ``else`` clause (binary vs. unary
  selection)
- Understand how to use logical operators within an ``if`` statement.
- Write code with nested conditionals
- Write a conditional using the ``if /elif/else`` structure
- Distinguish between chained and sequential conditionals, and identify when it is
  appropriate to use a particular option.

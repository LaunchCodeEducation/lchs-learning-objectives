Unit 3 - Strings Learning Objectives
====================================

Goals
-----

- Understand that strings are ordered *collections*.
- Work with strings using bracket notation, iteration, and common string
  methods.
- Compare strings to each other.

Objectives
----------

Students will:

- Understand and correctly interpret **zero-based indexing**.
- Understand that strings are indexed collections.
- Use bracket notation and index values to access a subset of a string.
- Use iteration to loop through the characters within a string.
- Use the **accumulator pattern** to build a new string.
- Describe what it means for strings to be **immutable**.
- Recognize that reassigning a new string to a variable does not violate the
  idea of string immutability.
- Find the length of a string using the ``len()`` function.
- Create strings with the newline and tab characters: ``\n``, ``\t``.
- Include quotes within strings.
- Correctly use the ``+`` and ``*`` operators to concatenate strings.
- Use template literals to create strings that rely on variable values.
- Recognize that string methods return new values without changing the
  original string.
- Use the ``format()`` method to insert values into a string.
- Use other common string methods: ``count()``, ``find()``, ``index()``,
  ``lower()``, ``replace()``, ``strip()``, ``upper()``.
- Use ``split()`` and ``list()`` to convert a string into a list of string
  elements.
- Use boolean methods like ``islower()`` to check the state of a string.
- Import the ``string`` module to access specific collections of characters
  (e.g. ``string.ascii_lowercase``, ``string.digits``, etc.). 
- Use the ``in`` operator to check if a specific string is present in a larger
  collection.

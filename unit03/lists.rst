Unit 3 - Lists Learning Objectives
==================================

Goals
-----

- Understand that lists are also ordered collections.
- Understand the syntax for creating new lists.
- Work with lists using bracket notation, iteration, and common list methods.

Objectives
----------

Students will:

- Understand that lists, like strings, are indexed collections.
- Assign a list literal to a variable.
- Create lists that store multiple values of the same or different data types.
- Use bracket notation and index values to access or modify one element in a
  list.
- Use bracket notation to access or modify a **slice** of multiple elements in
  a list.
- Use iteration to loop through the elements within a list.
- Recognize that lists are **mutable**, and describe what that means.
- Find the length of an list using the ``len()`` function.
- Understand what ``index out of range`` errors mean, and how to fix them.
- Use the **accumulator pattern** to increase or decrease the size of a list.
- Use common list methods: ``append()``, ``clear()``, ``count()``, ``index()``,
  ``insert()``, ``pop()``, ``remove()``, ``reverse()``, ``sort()``.
- Recognize which list methods modify the original list.
- Use the ``copy()`` method to make an independent clone of a list.
- Use the ``max()`` and ``min()`` functions to return the largest and smallest
  values in a list.
- Create lists that store other lists (i.e. multi-dimensional lists).
- Access elements within multi-dimensional lists.
- Use ``join()`` to convert a list of string elements into a single string.
- Use the ``in`` operator to check if a value is present in a list.
